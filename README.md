Kind jar is a cheerful web app designed to spread positivity through annonymous uplifting messages we can drop a short kind note like "You're awesome !" or "Don't give up - You've got this. " into our virtual jar then at anytime someone else can "draw a message" from the jar and recieve that encouragement, a small spark of joy from a stranger.
